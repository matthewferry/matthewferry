Hi, I'm Matthew, a designer 🤓, mostly of software. I currently live in the high desert of New Mexico 🏜. Hobbies include rock climbing 🧗, [chess](https://lichess.org/@/matthewferry) ♟️ (i'm absolutely terrible, but love it so much), and wasting entirely too much time [podcasting](https://so-so-cool.simplecast.com) 🎙️. In a past life, I made a lot of [noise](https://matthewferry.bandcamp.com). Sometimes you could call it music 🎶. Love anything pickled 🥒.
