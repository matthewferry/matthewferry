# Hi, I'm Matthew.

## Getting ~started~ to know me
I'm a designer ü§ì, mostly of software. I currently live in the high desert of New Mexico üèú. Hobbies include rock climbing üßó, [chess](https://lichess.org/@/matthewferry) ‚ôüÔ∏è (i'm absolutely terrible, but love it so much), and wasting entirely too much time [podcasting](https://so-so-cool.simplecast.com) üéôÔ∏è. In a past life, I made a lot of [noise](https://matthewferry.bandcamp.com). Sometimes you could call it music üé∂. Love anything pickled ü•í.

### The good and the bad

My **superpower** ü¶∏ is [Complexity Busting](https://superpowers.sypartners.com/cards/complexity-busting). I am drawn towards intellectual curiousity, pushing on assumptions, digging into big questions, and finding patterns/gaps. I love painting in broad strokes, finding meaning and signal amid noise, and am a convergent/analytical thinker. I'm generally a quick learner and adapter. I'm neurodivergent, finding hyper-focus (flow) easily when I enjoy a task and am a big procrastinator. This means I don't mind operating under time crunches and  usually need time constraints or deadlines as a forcing function.

My **weaknesses** ü¶π are in divergent and generative thinking. I have a tendency to operate on instinct and form opinions quickly. I'm impatient when things feel clear, but can be overwhelmed/paralyzed/stuck when I don't know the answer. While a quick learner, I am slow to proficiency and can get frustrated with plateaus. And because I'm neurodivergent, I can hyper-focus (get lost in flow) on the wrong things (or at the wrong time) and am a big procrastinator. This means I am often forgetful and late while anxious about being both (not one of those enviable people who are just late and enjoy taking their time or are happy to let details fall through the cracks).

### Motivators

- **I need to `make` and generate output regularly**. But, I can sometimes struggle to get things over the line when working completely alone. And because I prefer being in a band than performing a solo anyway, I work best in a team setting. I pair well with people who are playfully output-driven, high-energy, high-risk tolerent, and care a lot about quality and details. They counterbalance my analytical, introspective and cautious side.
- **I need recognition and praise**. I will be embarrassed and uncomfortable with it, but I also need it to stay motivated.
- **I need to strive for self-sufficiency**. This may seem to be in conflict with the first bullet point, but I like to be able to do things for myself when I can and not rely on others. In team situations, I like to be helpful outside my core responsibility when I can. At the same time, I need clarity on what I am responsible for so I know what is expected of me. 
- **I need substantial alone-time**. I'm an introvert, so I need space and time to recharge, do deep work, form thoughts, and create expressively without an audience. Filling my calendar with meetings will drain me and diminish my ability to output and be a useful person.
- **I need multiple outlets for creativity at a time**. This helps me lean into my ADHD instead of fighting it, but I am also prone to over-committing.
- **I need to be able to be silly, and to have time for play**. Being able to be silly or goofy with others helps me feel connected, engaged, and often inspires. Having time for unbounded play helps me feel energized.
- **I need very clear work/life boundaries**. I love working, but if I'm not careful, I can easily let myself be consumed by it. I have a family and hobbies I enjoy and need my time with them to be time with them. With my ADHD brain, I can be easily distracted and fall into work rabbit holes. To mitigate this, I don't allow notifications, and I'm strict about screen times and when and where I can access my work computers.

### How I work

#### Asynchronous vs synchronous work

I‚Äôm a **night owl** üåúü¶â and prefer quiet spaces for deep work. Because most of the world operates 9-5 and I struggle with being useful during the morning and early afternoons, I prefer asynchronous communication when possible so I can organize my schedule around the best times to do get things done. I love synchronous communication, but at work I prefer it for social connection, pairing/collaborating, and for when a meandering, back-and-forth conversation is necessary (e.g. I'm stuck and need to talk my way through a problem).

#### Personality

I love personality quizzes probably a little too much. They never paint a completely accurate picture of course and are mostly unscientific, but I just enjoy them and find they're useful as a starting point for self-reflection as well as forming empathy and getting to know what motivates others. So here are some of mine:

- [My sun, moon and rising](https://www.costarastrology.com/matthewferry): Capricorn, Aquarius, Leo
- [Enneagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality): 5, a Thinker
- [DISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment): Sc, a Planner
- [16 Personality Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers‚ÄìBriggs_Type_Indicator): INFJ
- [Creative Type](https://mycreativetype.com/): The Thinker
