# Hi, I'm Matthew.

## Getting started
I'm a designer ü§ì, mostly of software. I currently live in the high desert of New Mexico üèú. Hobbies include rock climbing üßó, [chess](https://lichess.org/@/matthewferry) ‚ôüÔ∏è (i'm absolutely terrible, but love it so much), and wasting entirely too much time [podcasting](https://so-so-cool.simplecast.com) üéôÔ∏è. In a past life, I made a lot of [noise](https://matthewferry.bandcamp.com). Sometimes you could call it music üé∂. Love anything pickled ü•í.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

My superpower ü¶∏ is in convergent and analytical thinking. According to the Superpowers game, I'm either a [Complexity Buster](https://superpowers.sypartners.com/cards/complexity-busting) or a [Gap Detector](https://superpowers.sypartners.com/cards/gap-detection), depending on the circumstance. I am curious and drawn to big philosophical questions. I am constantly trying to find order in chaos or the essense of a complex system. I like pushing on assumptions and looking for blindspots. I paint in broad strokes. I'm ADHD neurodivergent and find hyper-focus (flow) easily when I am interested in a task.
  
The flip side ü¶π of my superpower is that I'm not great at divergent and generative thinking. In my desire to simplify and reduce complexity, I can sometimes leave out important details or explore a wide range of possible alternative solutions. While I find flow easily for things that interest me, it is very hard for me to find and sustain the motivation necessary to complete things that are important but not personally interesting. And it is not uncommon for me to get sidetracked‚Äîsucked into exploring something that sparks my curiosity but is not the most critical thing to be working on. This can cause stress and anxiety, especially when I'm aware I'm doing it.
  
**How all this manifests:** 
- Even though I am good at unpacking a lot of information into simple take-aways, I often worry that I can't explain my thinking simply and succinctly. As a result, my communication style can be verbose and rambly. 
- I can be impatient when solutions feel clear to me but things are slow to progress or the collective team is still processing. I am forgetful at times and can appear aloof. 
  
**When working with me:** 
- Lean on me for distilling ideas, but don't ask me to write detailed specs. If deadlines are critical, make sure they're clearly communicated and agreed upon. I love getting in the weeds of a new problem and am always happy to pair if you need a partner to find a solution or to bounce ideas off of. 

### Motivators

- **I need to `make` and generate output regularly**. But, I can sometimes struggle to get things over the line when working completely alone. And because I prefer being in a band than performing a solo anyway, I work best in a team setting. I pair well with people who are playfully output-driven, high-energy, tolerent of risk, and care a lot about quality and details. They counterbalance my analytical, introspective and cautious side.
- **I need recognition and praise**. I will be embarrassed and uncomfortable with it, but I also need it to stay motivated.
- **I need to strive for self-sufficiency**. This may seem to be in conflict with the first bullet point, but I like to be able to do things for myself when I can and not rely on others. In team situations, I like to be helpful outside my core responsibility when I can. At the same time, I need clarity on what I am responsible for so I know what is expected of me. 
- **I need substantial alone-time**. I'm an introvert, so I need space and time to recharge, do deep work, form thoughts, and create expressively without an audience. Filling my calendar with meetings will drain me and diminish my ability to output and be a useful person.
- **I need multiple outlets for creativity at a time**. This helps me lean into my ADHD instead of fighting it, but I am also prone to over-committing.
- **I need to be able to be silly, and to have time for play**. Being able to be silly or goofy with others helps me feel connected, engaged, and often inspires. Having time for unbounded play helps me feel energized.
- **I need very clear work/life boundaries**. I love working, but if I'm not careful, I can easily let myself be consumed by it. I have a family and hobbies I enjoy and need my time with them to be time with them. With my ADHD brain, I can be easily distracted and fall into work rabbit holes. To mitigate this, I don't allow notifications, and I'm strict about screen times and when and where I can access my work computer/systems.
- **I need to feel like I'm progressing**. I'm generally a quick learner, but I am slow to proficiency and can be frustrated by hitting plateaus in skill growth. 

### How I operate

#### Asynchronous vs synchronous work: balancing communication

I‚Äôm a **night owl** üåúü¶â and prefer quiet spaces for deep work. Because most of the world operates 9-5 and I struggle with being useful during the morning and early afternoons, I prefer asynchronous communication when possible so I can organize my schedule around the best times to do get things done. I love synchronous communication, but at work I prefer it for social connection, pairing/collaborating, and for when a meandering, back-and-forth conversation is necessary (e.g. I'm stuck and need to talk my way through a problem).


#### Introversion vs Extroversion: where I fall on the scale

#### Personality heuristics

I love personality quizzes probably a little too much. They never paint a completely accurate picture of course and are mostly unscientific, but I just enjoy them and find they're useful as a starting point for self-reflection as well as forming empathy and getting to know what motivates others. So here are some of mine:

- [My sun, moon and rising](https://www.costarastrology.com/matthewferry): Capricorn, Aquarius, Leo
- [Enneagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality): 5, a Thinker
- [DISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment): Sc, a Planner
- [16 Personality Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers‚ÄìBriggs_Type_Indicator): INFJ
- [Creative Type](https://mycreativetype.com/): The Thinker
